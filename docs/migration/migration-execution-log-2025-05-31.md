 # Migration Execution Log: 2025-05-31

 The following documents the commands run and their output when executing the full WordPress→Hugo migration pipeline on 2025‑05‑31 from scratch.

 ## 1) Ensure local WordPress stack is running
 ```bash
 cd wordpress
 docker compose up -d
 ```

 ## 2) Remove any existing blog content directory (handled automatically)
 ```bash
 # The migration script will remove content/blog/ for a clean run.
 ```

 ```bash
 python3 migration/scripts/wp_to_hugo.py
 ```

 ```

 ## Observations and Next Steps
 - The migration script successfully wiped and regenerated the `content/blog/` directory, but it did not fetch any posts due to a database connection issue.
 - Verify that the WordPress/MySQL Docker container is running and reachable by the migration script.
 - Once the database connection is restored, rerun the migration pipeline to repopulate the blog content and audit image coverage again.
